# The `union` command for Unix text processing

Print the lines that are in any of the inputs.

Syntax:

    union <input> ...

Example:

    $ union 1.txt 2.txt
    => lines that are in either of the files.


## Notes

The order doesn't matter.

In set theory, this command is (A union B).

This command is currently implemented using `awk` and POSIX.
